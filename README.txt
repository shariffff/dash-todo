A Todo management plugin for WordPress site admins. Stay consistent and never forget anything.

== Description ==

The Todo Plugin is a tool designed to enhance productivity and task management within the WordPress admin area. This plugin allows admins to easily create and manage tasks, keeping track of what needs to be done.

You can manage the Todo from *Dashboard -> Todo* or from the *Dashboard widget*.

Note: If you toggle the *Todo widget*, a page reload is required. This is for Performance purpose.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why todo items are loading slowly? =
It depends on the site's REST API response. I'm trying to optimize it as much as possible.
= Where to report bugs or suggest improvements? =
I'm managing the plugin here: https://github.com/shariffff/dash-todo . Feel free to create issues. I'll try my best to help.
